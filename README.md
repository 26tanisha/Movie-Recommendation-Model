# Movie Recommendation System (Machine Learning)

## Overview

This project is a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on user selection.
The system computes similarity scores between movies using machine learning techniques and recommends the most relevant results.

The application is deployed using Streamlit to provide an interactive user interface.

## How It Works

Movie features are transformed into numerical vectors
Cosine similarity is used to measure similarity between movies
Based on the selected movie, the system recommends the top 5 most similar movies

## Technologies Used

-Python
-Pandas
-NumPy
-Scikit-learn
-Streamlit
